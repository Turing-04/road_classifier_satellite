Please append to this file the current accuracy you have for a given model (Unet, CNN, Xception... ? ) with the number of epochs / hyperparams

Essential for the report to come !


30 epochs, U-net -> 0.895 F1 score 0.933, training dataset with 1000 samples 

60 epochs, U-net -> 0.895 F1 score 0.945, training dataset with 1100 samples (antoine, only rotations / flipping but with repeting dataset)
