Please append to this file the current accuracy you have for a given model (Unet, CNN, Xception... ? ) with the number of epochs / hyperparams
And especially the loss at after each epoch -> To be recorded here after each training period

Essential for the report to come !


30 epochs, U-net -> 0.895 F1 score 0.933, training dataset with 1000 samples (from sratch weights)


60 epochs, U-net -> 0.895 F1 score 0.945, training dataset with 1100 samples (antoine, only rotations / flipping but with repeting dataset) (from scratch weights)
